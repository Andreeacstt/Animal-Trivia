			<h2>About the website</h2>
				<br>
				<p>This is a quiz website, consisting of 10 questions, all of them animal 
				related. <br> On the home page, there is a navigation bar on the right upper corner, 
				that will <br> take you to Author Page, Contact Page, and About Page, as well as
				the button <br> that opens the quiz.  On the first page, you will be asked for a
				name in order for <br> the quiz to start.  The questions are multiple-choice, 
				with four possible answers, <br> where only one has to be selected.  
				Throughout the quiz there are buttons for <br> “previous” and 
				“next” questions.  When all the questions are answered, the <br> submit button
				will prompt the results.  There is also a "play again" button that <br> will 
				restart the quiz.</p>
